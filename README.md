Godot Engine projects
The home page of this excellent game engine can be found here: https://godotengine.org/

## Exercises from books
My own exercices with some customizations from the book Godot Engine Development by Packt Publishing. I added some extra features to the exercises in order to have a better game experience. Also added a lot of comments in order to document the code.

## Reference sheet
I also added a pdf **reference sheet** that I made for Godot Engine 3.x.

### Future updates
Now reading the book Godot Engine Development, so more examples and changes to the reference sheet will follow one day.
